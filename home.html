At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

    <br><h1>Fables</h1>
        <p>
        Fables are a literary genre: succinct fictional stories, that features animals, plants, inanimate objects and forces of nature that are anthropomorphised and that illustrates or leads to a particular moral lesson. They have contrasting characters that take us through a lifelike journey, portraying good things and bad things and ultimately conclude with an moral. The moral will give one, an understanding of importance of right and good things. Similarly every individual will have a story, where he/she can be one of the character of the fable, where the choices made by him/her lead to an effect as an consequences of the decisions made and choices taken. These effects gives us many lessons or morals. The moral learnt are applicable to all and always contain the good and right choices of life, hence they must be spread to fill the world with good and right things through one’s actions.
